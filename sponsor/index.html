<p>Sponsorship of the HOT Summit demonstrates your organizationâ€™s commitment to reducing the impact of crises and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals through open map data.

<p>Sponsorship has a direct impact on the ability of mappers from least developed countries to attend, by enabling HOT and State of the Map to provide travel and admission scholarships.

<p>We have had a tremendous response to our scholarship outreach and are trying harder than ever to award as many scholarships as possible. We know not everyone can be a sponsor at the levels in our prospectus. We would be very grateful for a donation of any amount to HOT
